            Lions are the apex predators of the African savanna, with some
            populations also living in parts of Asia. These social animals live
            in groups and use teamwork to hunt and defend themselves. Male lions
            are notable for the thick mane around their necks, which protects
            this vulnerable area. Female lions are responsible for raising their
            cubs communally. At birth, lion cubs only weigh about 4 lbs, but as
            they grow, they can reach a mighty 400 lbs! Lions are carnivores,
            meaning their diet consists solely of meat. They prey on animals
            like zebras, antelopes, and wildebeests, playing a crucial role in
            maintaining the balance of the savanna ecosystem.
