            Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, ranging from 14 to
            18 feet tall. These peaceful herbivores primarily eat the leaves and
            twigs of acacia, mimosa, and wild apricot trees. They can consume up
            to 75 pounds of food per day, spending most of their time grazing.
            Their patterned coat provides camouflage, helping them blend in with
            the savanna landscape. Just like human fingerprints every giraffe
            has a unique same coat pattern. Female giraffes often go back to
            where they were born to give birth and they give birth standing up.
            Newborn giraffes can walk within an hour of being born! Giraffes
            reside in the grasslands of Africa, towering over all other animals.
