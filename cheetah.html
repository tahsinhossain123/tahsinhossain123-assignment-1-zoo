            Cheetahs are the fastest land animals in the world, capable of
            running up to 75 mph. Their primary habitat is the grasslands and
            savannas of Africa, but they are Africa's most endangered big cat. A
            cheetah typically weighs 46 to 160 pounds and measures up to 1.42
            meters long, with their stride reaching up to seven meters long at
            top speed. A cheetah's spots aren't just for camouflage, they also
            help regulate body temperature during sprints. Cheetahs have large
            hearts and lungs for faster oxygen supply when they are running at
            high speeds. Their flexible spine, lightweight body, and long legs
            are all adaptations that contribute to their incredible speed.
