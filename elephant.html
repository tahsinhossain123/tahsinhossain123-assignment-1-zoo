            Elephants, the largest land animals on Earth, are native to Africa
            and Asia. An African savanna elephant weighs about 12,000 pounds.
            Elephants are notable for their large trunks, which they use for
            many reasons, including breathing, drinking, feeding, grabbing,
            smelling, and trumpeting. An elephant's trunk has over 40,000
            muscles. Elephants are herbivores, meaning they only eat plants. Of
            all land mammals, elephants have the largest brains, making them
            exceptionally smart creatures.
